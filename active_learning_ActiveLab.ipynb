    "This notebook demonstrates a practical approach to active learning for training classification models with cleanlab. You can run this same code with *any* classifier model for any data type (image, text, tabular, audio, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "In active learning, we aim to construct a labeled dataset by collecting the fewest labels that still allow us to train an accurate classifier model. Here we assume data labeling is done in **batches**, and between these data labeling rounds, we retrain our classifier and combine it with an [ActiveLab algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11856) that decides which examples (i.e. datapoints) would be most informative to label next round. We assume there are **multiple** annotators to label the data, but since their labels are not necessarily perfect, we sometimes wish to ask a new annotator to provide an extra label for a previously labeled example. This active learning with multiple annotators setup is more widely applicable than academic studies which only consider labeling one example in each round or being limited to a single (noise-free) annotation per example. The code demonstrated here still works effectively in single annotator settings too!\n",
    "\n",
    "cleanlab provides two useful estimates for multi-annotator active learning: (1) an active learning score estimating how informative an additional label would be for each example, (2) accurate consensus labels for the previously labeled examples that can be used for classifier model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use these estimates for sequential active learning, showing how a classification model iteratively improves after (re)labeling examples for multiple rounds. Some examples in the initial dataset are allowed to have been labeled by multiple annotators, while other examples may have 0 labels (unlabeled pool). Cleanlab's active learning score indicates whether you should collect: another label for an already-labeled example (ie. having one more annotator review some potentially difficult example), or the first label for a new example that has not yet been labeled. The active learning scores properly weigh this trade-off based on cleanlab's estimates of label quality, in order to maximally improve your classifier with the fewest total labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Establish consensus labels (for the already labeled data). Use them to train a classifier model and then obtain out-of-sample predicted probabilities for each example.\n",
    "2. Compute active learning scores for every example, which estimate our current confidence in knowing its true label.\n",
    "3. Collect additional labels for the examples with the lowest active learning scores. These are the most potentially informative examples whose true label we are least certain of. \n",
    "4. Repeat the steps above to collect as many labels as your budget permits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of the model trained on the resulting dataset will generally match that of the same model trained on a much larger set of randomly collected labels. I.e. this is the most cost-effective way to train an accurate classifier!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we use a modified version of the [Wall-Following Robot Navigation](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&status=any&qualities.NumberOfClasses=gte_2&qualities.NumberOfInstances=between_1000_10000&id=1526) dataset, with multiple data annotators who each provide noisy labels."

It is not required that these examples be labeled by one new annotator (just done here for simplicity). These examples could instead be labeled by multiple new annotators, or multiple existing annotators, or any other combination. However you choose to collect additional labels, just be sure to properly update `multiannotator_labels` to reflect who provided these annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our example above utilized helper functions (eg. `setup_next_iter_data`, `add_new_annotator`) to collect new labels after each round of active learning. You *must* replace these helper functions in real applications with your own code to obtain new labels from human annotators and properly reformat the labeled/unlabeled data with the new labels."
